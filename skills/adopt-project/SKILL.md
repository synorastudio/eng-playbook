# Adopt a project

Bring an existing repository into alignment with the current applicable Engineering Conventions without overwriting its real constraints and established practices.

Audit first. Propose changes next. Write only after the user approves the proposal or revises it. Translate convention outcomes into project-owned guidance and Project Guardrails instead of copying central playbook prose. Leave package installation, framework choice, app tooling, and stack defaults outside this workflow.

## Adoption principle

Let the project's operating reality determine its Agent Operating System.

Project Adoption may produce a full Agent Operating System or a thin docs update. Create durable docs only when future agents need them to operate safely.

Running this workflow again is re-adoption. Audit the repository as it exists now; do not require or create a playbook version marker, installed-skill list, or machine-readable adoption manifest.

## Convention baseline

Audit for these outcomes while staying tech-agnostic:

- Repository reality is discoverable through a short Agent Guidance entry point and its linked sources.
- Durable knowledge is current and lives in its owning artifact.
- System boundaries are discoverable, with qualifying architecture trade-offs preserved in ADRs.
- Collaborative planning is the default for new or unclear work; building is a separate mode. Production work begins only when the user has explicitly told the agent what to build, one piece at a time, and produces proportionate verification evidence. Accepting a plan is not that go-ahead, and an agent never treats its own proposal as one.
- Applicable conventions are backed by project-owned controls that prevent violations or make them visible.
- Every commit entering integration history follows `<type>[optional scope][!]: <description>` with an allowed type: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `refactor`, `test`, `build`, `ci`, `chore`, `perf`, `style`, or `revert`. Descriptions are imperative, lowercase, and have no trailing period. Breaking changes use `!` and explain the break and migration path in the body when they are not obvious.
- Agent-generated work is attributed at the durable boundary that records it.

Prefer guardrails in this order: eliminate the failure through design; detect it through automated or external controls; guide the remaining judgment with concise rules or explicit procedures; rely on user review only for residual cases.

## Audit categories

Discover the project's actual operating environment. Do not introduce preferred tooling just because it is absent.

Audit:

- Agent guidance: `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, Cursor rules, commands, and repo-specific agent instructions.
- Docs anchors: README workflow sections, `LANGUAGE.md`, `LANGUAGE-MAP.md`, `docs/architecture.md`, and `docs/adr/`.
- Commit workflow: the merge strategy, the message that enters integration history, current commit format, and any automated or external checks.
- Workflow conventions: branch naming, PR template use, issue links, contribution docs, and review instructions.
- Attribution: how agent-generated repository changes and collaboration artifacts identify their agent author.
- Rule storage: whether detailed agent rules live in ordinary docs, tool-specific rule directories, or duplicated sources.
- Ignore files: `.gitignore`, `.dockerignore`, Cursor/Claude/agent ignores, and other tool-specific ignore files that already apply.
- Environment guidance: Doppler, `.env`, secrets managers, `.env.example`, local/staging/production envs, and how agents should handle secrets.
- Runtime and deployment guidance: where the project runs, where it deploys, how to start it locally, and how agents avoid touching production.
- Command registry: where common commands are documented and how agents should discover them without inventing stack-specific commands.
- Safety rules: data, auth, secrets, deployment, migrations, paid services, and destructive operations.
- Project Guardrails: architecture constraints, tests, static checks, continuous integration, repository settings, tracker states, service permissions, deployment gates, agent rules, and review practices.
- External controls: important protections or workflow states that do not live in Git, plus any repo pointer an agent needs to discover them.

## Classify findings

After auditing, classify findings:

- **Keep**: already matches the desired workflow.
- **Adopt**: existing convention should become the project default.
- **Add**: missing workflow anchor that is safe to create.
- **Ask**: conflict, ambiguity, hidden project knowledge, or multiple valid choices.
- **Deviation**: a deliberate failure to meet an applicable Engineering Convention that requires explicit approval.
- **Defer**: stack-specific setup outside this skill's scope.

Never assume absence means "create my preferred thing." First infer the project's current defaults.

## Adoption proposal

Before writing to the repo, present a concise adoption proposal.

Include:

- What the audit found.
- What existing conventions should be preserved.
- Which convention outcomes already have effective Project Guardrails.
- What files or docs should be added or updated.
- What missing outcomes need a guardrail, including external controls where appropriate.
- How the merge strategy will apply and guard the required commit form.
- How agent-generated work will be attributed at its durable boundaries.
- What should be skipped or deferred.
- Whether an existing integration workflow or tracker should be preserved, or the SynoraStudio default applied because the repository has none.
- Whether to consolidate detailed agent rules into ordinary docs and point to them from an `AGENTS.md` rules index.
- What assumptions need user confirmation.
- What hidden project knowledge would change the proposal.
- Which deliberate deviations, if any, require explicit approval.

Stop after the proposal. Continue only when the user approves it or supplies a revision. Apply the approved scope and incorporate the user's project knowledge.

Use this deviation rule exactly:

> Any deliberate failure to meet an applicable Engineering Convention requires explicit approval.

## Artifact scope

Adoption may create or update the same artifact universe as greenfield initialization, but only through the audit and proposal flow.

- `AGENTS.md`: repo-level operating instructions for future agents.
- `LANGUAGE.md`: bounded project vocabulary.
- `LANGUAGE-MAP.md`: routing for multiple language contexts.
- `docs/architecture.md`: current system shape and navigation.
- `docs/adr/`: durable decisions.
- Rules index: a short `AGENTS.md` section that points to detailed agent rule docs.
- README workflow sections: how the project expects agents and humans to work.
- Review templates and contribution docs: collaboration, commit, branch, issue-linking, and review workflow.
- Ignore files: keep generated files, secrets, dependencies, and tool noise out of version control.
- Environment and deployment notes: where the project runs, how envs are managed, and what agents must not touch.
- Project Guardrails: project-owned architecture, code, checks, settings, tracker controls, guidance, or review practices that prevent or detect convention violations.

Keep generated or revised docs short. Adoption should make the repo safer for future agents, not create empty bureaucracy.

## Route specialist work

Route deeper durable knowledge work to the owning skill instead of expanding this skill's scope.

- Use `maintain-language` for substantial vocabulary work, multiple local language contexts, or unclear naming.
- Use `write-adr` when a decision is hard to reverse, surprising without context, and based on a real trade-off.
- Use `maintain-living-docs` when architecture, onboarding, operations, or project-specific guidance needs more than a thin adoption note.

## Keep AGENTS.md short

When creating or revising `AGENTS.md`, preserve useful project guidance and include the baseline commit and attribution rules. Commits entering integration history use `<type>[optional scope][!]: <description>`. Descriptions are imperative, lowercase, and have no trailing period. Breaking changes use `!` and explain non-obvious breaks and migration paths in the body. Add the agent as a co-author of agent-generated commits, and visibly attribute agent-authored pull request descriptions, reviews, comments, and tracker artifacts.

`AGENTS.md` must stay short because agents load it into context. Treat it as an index and routing layer, not a full policy document.

- Prefer 5-8 high-signal bullets.
- Link to deeper docs for details.
- Include only what an agent must know before choosing what to read next.
- Do not copy long environment, deployment, command, or review guidance into `AGENTS.md`; point to the relevant doc instead.

## Store rules for any agent

Prefer `AGENTS.md` as the universal agent entry point, with detailed agent rules stored as ordinary repo documentation.

- Add or preserve a short rules index in `AGENTS.md` when detailed guidance lives elsewhere.
- Prefer focused docs under `docs/` for long-lived rules, such as `docs/agentic-workflow.md`.
- Preserve existing tool-specific rule files when they are part of the project's real workflow, but do not create or expand them by default.
- If the repo has duplicated or conflicting guidance across `AGENTS.md`, Cursor rules, Claude files, `.agents/rules/`, or docs, include the consolidation choice in the adoption proposal and ask before changing it.

Use tool-specific rule directories only when the user explicitly asks for them or the repo already depends on them. Shared guidance should have one project-owned source of truth that Codex, Cursor, and other agents can follow.

## Apply the SynoraStudio defaults

Existing project reality wins for the integration workflow: where the audit reveals a real one, preserve it and link to its source from `AGENTS.md` only when future agents need the pointer; where it reveals none, apply the default. Apply SynoraStudio's standing defaults instead of interviewing the user:

- Integration workflow: squash-merge into the normal integration branch, with the pull request title validated as the Conventional Commit message.
- Issue tracker: Linear by default. Record in `AGENTS.md` the Linear team and project that resolve an issue id, and ensure the workspace has two label groups: `type` (`feature`, `decision`, `docs`, `bug`, `chore`, `spec`) and `resolution` (`research`, `grilling`, `prototype`). When the audit finds the project already on a different tracker, record that in `AGENTS.md` as the client-tracker exception rather than keeping it silently. Linear owns Decision Maps, Decision Issues, Specs, Feature Issues, and Sub-Issues.

If an existing convention conflicts with a default, is incomplete, or appears tool-specific rather than project-specific, include the ambiguity in the adoption proposal and ask before changing it. Do not interview the user about local dev-server ownership, branch naming, PR templates, or review flow, and do not inject other preferences the repository has not chosen.

## Completion report

Report:

- What was added or updated.
- What was skipped.
- What was deferred to another skill or future session.
- What user guidance changed from the original proposal.
- What still needs a decision.
- What Project Guardrails were added, preserved, or deliberately deferred.
- What approved deviations remain.

Finish when every approved proposal item is applied or explicitly deferred, every existing convention touched by the work is preserved or deliberately replaced, and the report accounts for each proposal item. Do not leave behind an adoption manifest, playbook version marker, or copied convention document.
